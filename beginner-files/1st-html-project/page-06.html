    <h1>                You are missing nothing my friend. <br>
        Do not concern yourself with what was and what will be. <br>
                There's a saying:               
                    yesterday is history, 
                        tomorrow is a mystery, 
                            but today is a gift. 
                    That is why it is called the present.
